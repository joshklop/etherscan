To-do:

- Fix bugs relating to parse order. We need to validate flags of parent commands before executing terminal command.
- Fix existing todos in the code
- CI: tests on major platforms, coverage, linting
- Additional Etherscan endpoints: start with downloading contract source code
- README + documentation.
